                    <p>We're BIMstream.</p>
                    <p>BIMstream is an interdisciplinary family of architects, engineers, construction professionals, and creative technologists who have a passion for future-proofing businesses by preparing their assets for the digital age.</p>
                    <p>With a pulse on the state-of-the-art information modeling technology, our team prides ourselves in the ability to scan and model properties of all shapes and sizes to bring your portfolio to the technology 4.0 era.</p>
                    <p>We want to supply you with real-time information on the status of your building so all developments can be planned, mapped, and orchestrated from your building's digital twin.</p>
                    <h2>We scan buildings and digitize portfolios.</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>We do our Research.</strong> First, we learn about your space: how many floors, how it's structured, we review model layout documents, we assemble an idea for how much work will need to go into this to make things work well.</li>
                        <li><strong>We scan your Reality.</strong> Then, once the plan has been cleared and the expectations are properly set, we scan. Using state-of-the-art sensor equipment, we capture your reality and generate point clouds and create the digital twins.</li>
                        <li><strong>We model the Digital Twins.</strong> Our modeling team (exclusively Architects and Engineers) process the data we gather and model a twin of the scanned information. We have an extensive QA/QC workflow that ensures near perfection.</li>
                        <li><strong>We host your Digital Twins.</strong> Finally: Your buildings, online and in the cloud. Forget the nuanced self-management and organization of this information. It's confusing - we get it. That's why we've built your one-stop shop for all your building data. Share with your Enterprise. Share with your AEC teams. Youâ€™re in control.</li>
